(a) How many commits have been done to the repository by the end of step 8?

3 commits had been done.
1) modify readme.md
2) update status.txt
3)add answers.txt

(b) When was the file .gitignore modified last?

I am assuming this question is asking the last modified date of file in remote repository.
Date:   Thu Sep 15 10:29:34 2016 -0400

(c) How many times was each of the files inside the src folder modified? 	

There were 2 commits to the src folder.
In the first commit 4 files were added.
A       src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/RoleGame.java
A       src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/Sword.java
A       src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/Weapon.java
A       src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/WeaponFactory.java
In the second commit one more file was added and one file was modified.
A       src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/BasicWeapon.java
M       src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/Sword.java

So all files were added once. Additionally Sword.java was modified once.

(d) What is the difference between git log and git status?

git status is used to compare changes between the files in the working directory and the current 
HEAD commit in the repository.

git log is used to view the history of the commits in the repository. You can perform various 
forms of filtering on the information about the commits by specifying options to the 
git log command.

(e) What command would you use to see the commits where "RoleGame.java"
was one of the commited files?

The command:
gitk <path to the file> E.g (when in working directory) gitk src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/RoleGame.java
opens a GUI showing the commits and the difference between the commits.

The command:
git log -- <path to filename> E.g. (when in working directory) git log -- src/edu/fsu/cs/cen5035/RoleGame.java
shows commits history in the command line

(f) What command would you use to see the commits whose commit message
contains the word "file"?

git log --grep='file'

(g) What command would you use to see the commits made by "Alice" between
09/01/2016 and 09/16/2016? 

git log --author='Alice' --before='9/16/2016' --after='9/1/2016'
